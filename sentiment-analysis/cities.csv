jvq7f7a,Philadelphia,15o5ph2,-0.9,"The shit I see people pull regularly is so shocking and enraging. There‚Äôs a driver I see on my commute sometimes who will just blow through all the red lights on Henry Avenue, driving like a lunatic along the shoulder to pass by everyone. People recklessly switching lanes over and over as if they‚Äôre not operating a giant weapon and could easily kill or injure the people around them, just to get a few cars ahead. I feel powerless to change it, but just want to say I can commiserate as I‚Äôm sure many others can."
jvq7sy3,Philadelphia,15o5ph2,-0.85,Following. My wife and I were struck this year by a reckless driver while we were just minding our own business on the sidewalk and it has changed our whole lives.

jvqdy5z,Philadelphia,15o5ph2,-0.6,"I never understood why people do this, you can't be saving that much time... you're in a city. You're going to run into another stop sign and/or red light in like 500 feet. Then again, I guess they just fucking plow through those as well. Why can't they just leave their house 3-5 god damn minutes earlier?"
jvquppw,Philadelphia,15o5ph2,-0.6,"I think the first step is to stop being proud of shit like rolling stops. People will be like ""lmao it's a Philly thing like cheesesteaks and wooder ice!"" and then turn around and wonder why they nearly get killed every time they cross the street."

jxhsooe,Philadelphia,15z52n7,0.5,"Do religions organizations get paid for these services?  I‚Äôm just curious because it seems like the city, state or federal government should be doing this.  I‚Äôm an atheist but I certainly applaud and appreciate the great work some religious organizations provide.  
I feel like those of us who really want to help the homeless should do so through these organizations."
jxf2za0,Philadelphia,15z52n7,-0.6,"Philadelphia has so much resources for the people who need it, there's only one stipulation... No drugs! Stop giving money to the shits panhandling, they're not homeless they just have a drug problem"

jxgu8fi,Philadelphia,15z52n7,0.1,there‚Äôs a song about this
jvbto7u,Philadelphia,15lnkfi,-0.5,I wonder if it will actually come back in 2024. The lineups and quality of production have been steadily dropping every year for a while now. I wouldn't be shocked if this is it for Made in America festival.

jvboisy,Philadelphia,15lnkfi,-0.6,Lineup was lackluster compared to previous years too
jw5lgy1,Philadelphia,15qwixu,0.9,I can't believe this is actually an issue to be debated. Of course all kids should get at least one free meal if they're compelled to be in school all day. What kind of society are we that we bring capitalism concerns into children eating? Who are objectors trying to 'stick it' to? The kids themselves??

jwq2lpy,Arlington,15ttitv,-0.6,"I‚Äôm pretty sure the city is afraid of homelessness  increasing. It wouldn‚Äôt be that more people were unemployed but the homeless from fort worth and dallas will relocate to Arlington. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good reason. Homeless is a symptom of our poor social safety net. Along with transportation, we need to be pairing it with public resources for homeless people. We need more shelters to handle in the very real influx. Without that, it is a net negative for the city over all. It will cost A LOT of money. If you think the cost of living now is crazy. Just wait. If you are suggesting that the 2 social issues of transportation and homelessness are not tied together and we should have transportation without addressing the city‚Äôs dilemma, I can‚Äôt say I agree. In other words, if it‚Äôs not worth doing right, then it isn‚Äôt worth doing. Just my personal opinion.

jv9ei1y,Shanghai,15l6tub,0.0,"1. Notify the Police (110) and Juweihui. Make noise about this. Tell them how you feel and don't be shy about that. Let them know if you feel threatened, are scared or feel the victim of racism. If you are too quiet about this they will just try to close the ticket and do nothing. This is all about how forcefully you complain. If you have a Chinese friend to assist you now is a good time to call them. If no resolution comes after the first call contact the police again. Every new call generates a new ticket they have to close and the more unresolved tickets the further this escalates until some very senior people have to show up. You can seriously damage their stats, which is what counts, this way. I don't think it will come to that, usually the police are fairly good with security and quality of life issues in Shanghai.

So, my partner and I moved into this apartment a few months ago. At first, everything seemed normal just the usual apartment noises hearing neighbors close doors or moving furniture. But recently, things got a little weird though.

It all started with these strange noises in the middle of the night. We tried to ignore them, but they just kept getting weirder. Almost like loud whispers or humming you could hear it loud if you put your ear against the wall. Then we started finding these yellow notes placed under the door. They are covered in what looks like Chinese calligraphy. Neither of us can read Chinese, so we have no clue what they said. I decided to take some of these notes to a local friend at work. I figured he could help me translate them or at least tell me what they were about. He said he didn't understand it but it looked"
